# react-contact-manager-without-state-manager
A very basic contact manager that allows you to add contacts through the code and delete contacts with button 
(Not that useful haha, its just for react exercise)

There's no state manager used (ie Redux or Context API).
I just handled state myself between components. The state sharing isn't too complex.

Features:
- Toggling contact info with arrow icon
- Deleting contacts with red "x" button
- Adding contacts through the code

You're free to pull this and build it further! :)
